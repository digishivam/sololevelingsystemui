Certainly! Here’s a README description tailored for the Solo Leveling System UI code given above:

# Solo Leveling System UI

A responsive web-based “System” status window inspired by the popular manhwa/anime **Solo Leveling**. Built with HTML, CSS, and [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/), this interface mimics the RPG-style UI seen by hunters, displaying user stats, experience points, and inventory.

## Features

- **Modern, themed system window**: Emulates the iconic "System" look from Solo Leveling.
- **XP Progress Bar**: Visual representation of current experience toward the next level.
- **Stat Display**: Shows representative stats such as Strength, Agility, Stamina, and Intelligence.
- **Inventory Section**: List items currently held by the user.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on desktop and mobile thanks to Bootstrap’s grid system.
- **Level Up Button**: Ready for extension with custom Level Up logic.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download**
   - Save the HTML code into a `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`).

2. **Open in Browser**
   - Simply open your file in a modern browser. No installation or backend required.

3. **Customization**
   - Change character info, stats, and inventory items by editing corresponding parts in the HTML.
   - Alter the XP bar by modifying the inline `width` style and XP numbers.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsive layout and UI components (CDN linked, no install needed)
- **CSS** for a stylized, thematic interface
